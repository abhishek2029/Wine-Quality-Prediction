# Wine-Quality-Prediction

1 - In this project, we predict the wine quality and compare the results among 4 different classification models to determine the best working model for the dataset.

2 - I have used the following classification models : Support Vector Machine(SVM). Naive Bayes, Random Forest and kNN.

3 - I have included the dataset here, but you can also find the dataset at the following link:      https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009

4 - You need to have python installed and install libraires as required or install anaconda.

5 - You can run the code on jupyter notebook or through terminal.
